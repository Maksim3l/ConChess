An app I made in 2nd year of high school for a console chess game - Unfinished

I am currently working on revising this app a little at a time. Right now focusing on doing the math for the rest of the pieces and not letting pieces take spots that are already taken.
Also removing all the unnecessary lines of lists being made at the beginning and making it better structured.
